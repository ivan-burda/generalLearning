Negatives
-All CSS in a single file, instead of using css modules 
-Relies on binding methods in a class component state instead of using methods based on arrow functions for which the correct this binding is done implicitely
-several components in a single file do not look like an approach that improves orientation 


Positives
-getting a different vies: React.Component, instead of importing the Component and refering to the import 
-explains {children} really well
-explains well PropTypes validations
-default prop values
-component reusability
-React Context
-Router query strings 
-Dynamic imports


A great course. Even though I had already got through the React part of https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/ and built my own Habit-tracker app, I still managed to learn lot, see things from a different perspective and experience several aha moments. This is really a gem for anyone learning React. The course does not take too much time, yet, teaches react on building a complete app and even deploying it via Netlify. 
My aha moments were related to children, propTypes, passing data via query strings, dynamic importing.
