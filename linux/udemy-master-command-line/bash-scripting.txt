FILE SETUP 
Create a text file with nano, such as: scriptname.sh 
Write the very first line to indicate this is a bash script: 
#!/bin/bash = this must be the 

fyi: Terminal tells us the interpreter route if we type: which bash 

RUN SCRIPTS 
bash scriptname.sh = this will run the script
Tip: move the script to ~/bin (if the folder does not exist, create it)
mv ~/Desktop/backup.sh ~/bin
Tip2: Rename the script: mv backup.sh backup 
Allow a file to be executed as a script: 
1)chmod +x backup   - this means: change mode - add the execute option
2)nano .bashrc
3)Add a new line at the end: PATH:"$PATH:$HOME/bin"

What is a different between an alias and a bash script?
Aliases can be just one-liners
Scripts can be more comples and scheduled to run by Cron

CRON - Scheduling script runs 
crontab -e  = e means "edit"
Select: 1 = nano 
Change the editor: edit the ~/.selected_editor file, or run the command: select-editor


* = every 
m = 0-59; can be also multiple values, e.g.: 0,15,30,5,59; */15 = every 15 minutes
h = hour, 0-23
dom = day of the months, 1-31; */3 = every 3 days
mon = 1-12, or JAN-DEC
dow = day of the week, 0-6; MON-SUN
command

To avoid any hassle, just make sure to follow the video exactly, and put the backup script into your ~/bin folder with execution permissions (chmod +x backup)
