FILE SETUP 
Create a text file with nano, such as: scriptname.sh 
Write the very first line to indicate this is a bash script: 
#!/bin/bash = this must be the 

fyi: Terminal tells us the interpreter route if we type: which bash 

RUN SCRIPTS 
bash scriptname.sh = this will run the script
Tip: move the script to ~/bin (if the folder does not exist, create it)
mv ~/Desktop/backup.sh ~/bin
Tip2: Rename the script: mv backup.sh backup 
Allow a file to be executed as a script: 
1)chmod +x backup   - this means: change mode - add the execute option
2)nano .bashrc
3)Add a new line at the end: PATH:"$PATH:$HOME/bin"

What is a different between an alias and a bash script?
Aliases can be just one-liners
Scripts can be more comples and scheduled to run by Cron
